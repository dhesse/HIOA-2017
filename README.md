# HIOA Big Data Analytics Summer Course

In this repository, you will find practical teaching materials and
data needed for the examples. Feel free to explore and try out
things. If you are using the docker image for the course, be aware
that the contents of the directory you find this message in will be
cleared after each restart. This means

- You will loose any changes you make to the files found here.
- You cannot break anything, so feel free to experiment.

**Happy hacking!**
