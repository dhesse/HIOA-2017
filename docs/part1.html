<li>Head over to <a href="https://google.com/trends">google trends</a> and download a <code>.csv</code> file of a number of search terms of your choice.</li>
<li>Read the data in a notebook and make a plot showing search interest over time.</li>
<li>Let <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> be the i-th week search interest of a given search term. Calculate the (k + 1)-week averages, defined by <br /><span class="math display">$$ \hat c_i^k = \frac 1 {k + 1} \sum_{l = i - k}^{i} c_l\,,$$</span><br /> and the derivation <br /><span class="math display">$$ \delta_i^k = c_i - \hat c_i^k\,.$$</span><br /> Plot the 4- and 8-week averages and their deviations. What trends do you observe?</li>
<li>Create a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> document containing the plots and your observations.</li>
<li>Using the <code>csv</code> package, write your calculated averages and the deviations to a file.</li>
<li>Go through the list of data sets located on <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets">github</a> and pick one in <code>.csv</code> or <code>JSON</code>, read it, make some plots and write down your observations.</li>
